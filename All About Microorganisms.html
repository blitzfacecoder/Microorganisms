        <h2> <font color="#000080"> <u> Where are they found? </u> </font> </h2>
     <font size="5"> <b> Microorganisms are very hardy and are found in almost any kind of environment. They are found in 
    in the hottest of deserts and in the coolest icy polar regions. Some microorganisms 
live in cracks in the sea floor and some can even survive volcanic eruptions. Microorganisms 
are also found in salt water and even inside our body. They are hardy because of a very 
hard covering called cyst which they form around themselves when the conditions are unfavourable.

<h2> <font color="#000080"> <u> Types of Microorganisms:- </u> </font> </h2>
<font size="5"> <b> There are 5 types of microorganisms:- </b>
    <ul> 
        <font color="green">     
        <li> Algae (Ex- Spirogyra, Laminaria) </li>
        <li> Protozoa (Ex- Amoeba, Paramecium) </li>
        <li> Fungi (Ex- Yeast, Agaricus) </li>
        <li> Bacteria (Ex- Lactobacillus, Rhizopus) </li>
        <li> Viruses (Ex- Corona, Ebola) </li>
    </font>
    </ul>
    <h2> <font color="red"> <u> Algae </u> </font> </h2>
    <b> 
        Algae are a diverse group of aquatic organisms that have the ability to conduct photosynthesis.
        It is a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades. 
        <font color="green">
            Ex- Spirogyra, Fucus, Laminaria, Chlamydomonas.
        </font>
    </b>
    <h2> <font color="red"> <u> Protozoa </u> </font> </h2>
    <b>
        Protozoa are single celled organisms. They come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from an Amoeba which can change its shape to Paramecium with its fixed shape and complex structure. They live in a wide variety of moist habitats including fresh water, marine environments and the soil.
        <font color="green">
            Ex- Amoeba, Paramecium, Giardia, Trypanosoma.
        </font>


    </b>
    <h2> <font color="red"> <u> Fungi </u> </font> </h2>
    <b> Fungi are a group of living organisms which are classified in their own kingdom. This means they are not animals, plants, or bacteria
        <font color="green">
            Ex- Agaricus, Yeast, Rhizopus, Penicillium.
        </font>
    </b>
    
    
    
    <h2> <font color="red"> <u> Bacteria </u> </font> </h2>
    <b> Bacteria are small single-celled organisms. Bacteria are found almost everywhere on Earth and are vital to the planet's ecosystems. 
    Some species can live under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. The human body is full of bacteria, and in fact is estimated to contain more bacterial cells than human cells.
    <font color="green">
    Ex- Lactobacillus Bacteria and Rhizobium Bacteria. </b> </font>

    <h2> <font color="red"> <u> Viruses </u> </font> </h2>
    <b>
        A virus is an infectious agent that can only replicate within a host organism. Viruses can infect a variety of living organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals. Viruses are so small that a microscope is necessary to visualize them, and they have a very simple structure.
        <font color="green">
            Ex- Corona Virus, Ebola Virus, Influenza (A) Virus. </b> </font>

<ol>
<li> Microorganisms are used to make medecines and vaccines which protect us from several communicable diseases! </li>
<li> Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa help by decomposing the tissues of dead organisms to get their food. 
    Without bacteria, piles of dead organisms would cover the earth!
</li>
<li> Bacteria are useful in leather and jute industries. Tanning (to make animal skin into leather by treating it with chemicals)
    is done with the help of bacteria. </li>
<li> In the villages, animal waste, leafy waste from crops etc. is decomposed by bacteria
    in the absence of oxygen to produce methane, which is used as a fuel. It is one of the chief constitutions of biogas.
